## üèÅ Startup

1. `docker-compose build` to build the image
2. `docker-compose up` to bring up the container (add `-d` to run in the background, but you need to remember to run `docker-compose down` to close it)
3. `docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate` to do the initial migration
4. `docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser` to create yourself a user to sign in to the admin console at `/admin`
5. Go to `localhost:8000/admin` and sign in with the user you have created

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Context

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

```
Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It‚Äôs free and open source.
```

You can run Django operations by running `docker-compose exec web manage.py <command>`.

In `pokemon/models.py`, we have models for each object represented in the database.

Django uses the models to create your migrations (up and down migrations) for you with the `makemigrations` command. You can also use the `migrate` command to migrate the database to a specific migration state.

The `__str__` method of a model returns how it will be represented in the admin dashboard.

## üí™ The Challenge

You have a postgres database which contains some schema - recreate this schema with the Django ORM.

Hint: don't do this manually - imagine you are migrating a complex database over to use an ORM.

Beware - autogenerated models may have incorrect foreign keys.
